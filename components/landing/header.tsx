/**
 * Portal-specific composition of the registry's `NyuchiHeader` (L7 shell).
 *
 * No design or behaviour lives here — this file only configures the
 * `navItems` (the portal's four top-level architecture surfaces) and
 * the three-icon `pillActions` group (Search, Fundi, Avatar) that PR #52
 * established as the brand identity marker.
 *
 * Anything that would require a different header shape (logo, sticky,
 * scroll title, back button, blur background, etc.) belongs in
 * `components/mukoko/mukoko-header.tsx` (the registry source of truth).
 * Keep this file under 30 lines.
