/**
 * Top-level navigation.
 *
 * Architecture rule:
 *  - Header surfaces only 4 top-priority destinations
 *    (Components, Brand, Architecture, Docs).
 *  - Footer holds the complete navigation (every other page).
 *  - The Bundu Family menu is the only top-level menu in the header,
 *    so cross-ecosystem jumps stay one click away.
 *
 * All other Nextra pages are kept (Foundations, Design, Patterns, Charts,
 * Blocks, Registry, Content, API) but marked `display: "hidden"` so they
 * still build and render, just don't clutter the navbar.
